# Constructor-Word-Guess

This is a hangman-type word guessing game. It is run entirely in the command line using inquirer, constructors, and modules. 

A good intro to modules and constructors. I learned it is best for each segement of code to only be responsible for a select number of things. It is tempting to add functions and utility to individual modules, but As I learned, this is not best and can lead to very confusing bugs and confusing code in general. 

The index.js depends soley on the word.js, and the word.js depends soley on the letter.js. When I first began my code, I tried to make index be able to access letter, but soo realized this made things way more complex that needed. After talking it out with another developer, I realized that many of my bugs and errors were a result of my faulty organization. 

Object are really neat and tidy, and I enjoy learning more about them. They seem like they have nearly limitless potential.
